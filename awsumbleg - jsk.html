It was built upon land that consisted of 7 hills during Rome&#39;s height. The city went through a radical change through its existance, with it starting off as a city of bricks and ending its life as a city of marbles. Rome is truly legitimately 1st of the Romes. <br> Constantinople - The City of World&#39;s desires - was the second Rome to have ever been built. It, much like first one, started off as a mere colony. It was also built upon a landscape surrounded by 7 hills. It experienced a radical change much like 1st one, as it was turned from an unimportant colony into a city of grand importance in an unexpected turn of event when Constantine made Byzantion Rome&#39;s capital and made Byzantion into New Rome and named it after himself. <br> Moscow - Third Rome - was for the longest time the least legitimate of all Romes. Its location and its evolution follow same route as first two, however. Moscow, much like the previous two Romes, was built on a land with 7 hills. It also used to be a meager and unimportant city for a substantial part of its existance and suddenly exploded in importance. Moscow, however, as been seen as an illegitimate Rome in the eyes of non-Romans. It used to be the most illegitimate Rome until 4th Rome was created. <br> Helsinki is 4th Rome. Capital of Finland is the new Rome. While at first it appears that there is no legitimacy to Helsinki. In fact you could even say Moscow has more legitimacy when compared to Helsinki. There is, however, symbolical legitimacy to Helsinki. <br> Who were the citizens of Byzantium? Greeks. Who were the citizens of Russia? Slavs. Who were the citizens of Finland? Finns. Now comes the next question: Whose subjects were they? Greeks were former subjects of Rome, Slavs former subjects of Byzantium, and Finns former subjects of Russia. Symbolically, each new Rome is lead by former subjects of the previous one, but this time the lower class subjects are the new 1st class citizens. <br> Helsinki, much like previous 3 Romes, experienced a sudden change. It was re-located from mildly inland to coast by the Russian Tzars. All Romes after the 1st one received investments from the previous Rome. Rome rebuilt Constantinople, Constantinople invested resources into Moscow, and Moscow industrialized Helsinki. <br> Each of the new Romes avenged the death of the previous one. When Rome fell to Barbaric Germans Byzantium avenged its death and humiliated the Germans war after war. When Byzantium fell to Ottomans Russia waged 12 wars of which only 9 were Russian victories and two of the times when Russia lost to Ottomans were times when Ottomans had other western countries on its side, like Germany or Britain, thus meaning only once did Ottomans manage to defeat Russia in a 1-on-1 war. And when Russia fell to Soviets Finland stood and humiliated Soviet Union with Winter War and Continuation War&#39;s casualties and forced Soviets to use an enormous portion of their army to take care of a couple of tens of thousands of foreign soldiers. Due to this similarity it is clear that humiliation of previous Rome&#39;s destroyer is part of legitimization of the new Rome. <br> While historically and culturally speaking Finland is not an heir of Rome, symbolically speaking Helsinki is a successor to Rome."</P>';
